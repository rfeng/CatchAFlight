CatchAFlight

This program is designed to tell you when your next flight is depending on where you want to go.

Airports are stationary, but airplanes are generated randomly at certain intervals of time.

"Time" is represented by the Calendar class, which takes real time and scales it.  Time passes faster in the instance of CatchAFlight.
